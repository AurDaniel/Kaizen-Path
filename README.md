Kaizen: Agile method for continuous improvement. 

Applying kaizen, we focus on small and regular improvements to our work processes. It involves constantly asking ‘What can we do to improve?’ 🤔 and eliminating egos and interpersonal barriers to reduce waste through concise and standardised processes.
